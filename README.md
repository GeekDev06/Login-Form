# Login-Form
<br>
This is my First Git Repository. In this project, I have made a Login form using basic skills of HTML and CSS. It is a basic Login form containing a Username and Password entries to enter the given details and at last, a Login button. A condition is also imposed of having minimum 8 characters in the password, or else it won't except.
